## 💡 About Me
Marketing and sales professional with an MBA and hands-on experience in banking and customer relationship management. I thrive on building trust, solving client challenges, and driving growth through strategic planning and clear communication.

Currently learning **cybersecurity** with a focus on **SOC Tier 1 fundamentals** through TryHackMe and preparing for **CompTIA Security+** self-study. My goal is to build strong technical skills first before pursuing certifications if needed.  

Open to opportunities that allow me to apply my marketing experience or cybersecurity skills in practical projects.
